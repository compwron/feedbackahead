Longer scenarios are easier to play (in general, 3-4 lines is too short; 15 is too long. Line length also matters: 4 lines of multiple-sentence scenarios can be 'just right')

Discussion probably needs to be timeboxed

More context for scenarios is good

Fishbowl format is great: trade out one person every scenario

Some scenarios are too long or have language that is too complex

Perhaps discuss "the prime directive", "feedback guidelines" or "desired outcomes of feedback" even among experienced groups

Have participants write down what they think are the important points / advice / lessons on post-it notes during the session, put on board during/after.

Running a mini-retro at the end is VERY VALUABLE

Tokens for A and B are awesome - just two post-its to pass around, even.
