notes: give to lateral onboarding?

non 1x1 interactions - consulting - "why did this break?"

impostor syndrome - like 8 humble?

when you ask for feedback and someone doesn't want to give it / doesn't give it

smeone won't accept feedback

conflicting feedback (talk more, talk less)


From TWU54:
- total radio silence from an entire group (e.g. PO meeting facilitation feedback, have sent email with specific points + reminded at standup)
- written feedback (maybe a scenario with example emails)
- culture differences scenario (maybe several of these...)
- interrupted feedback (person A has 3 items to get through, but after talking about the first item of feedback, person B starts a long discussion / looking at the code of the first scenario and they never get to the rest of the items) - (contributed by Natalia)

Questions:
- How do we show that the feedback is important?
- What to do if people ignore your feedback?
