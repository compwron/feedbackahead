notes: give to lateral onboarding?
notes: record this and post it?

- aggressive feedback reaction
- personal: unprofessional attire
- life stuff going on
- condescending
- giving feedback "you took credit for my idea" and have the recipient become victim-y and makes it difficult to give them feedback
- defensive (inturruptive) excuses to feedback
- jr to sr feedback
- lateral: how it was done at MY company
- howto ask team for feedback
