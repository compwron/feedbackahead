Giving feedback to someone much more senior than you

A: Hey, do you have a minute for feedback?
B: Sure
A: Ok, so I know that you've been doing this for a long time. I don't understand something-
B: Oh?
A: I'm not sure why you constantly remind the client developers of the deadline we're missing. It just seems to annoy them.
B: Well, I have a strategic master plan, bwa ha ha
A: I just wish that you could explain more to me and the team so that we're not uncomfortable and uninformed.
B: I'll try, but it might take a long time and you might not understand, and you still have to do it.
A: Please try to explain more. I'm worried about this.
