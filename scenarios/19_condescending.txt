Receiving condescending feedback
Think about: What is person A thinking? What might person B be feeling? What should either of them do here?

A: Ok so some feedback for you-
B: Okay
A: I know that this project is hard right now, but it's going to be okay.
B: Er, it's not that hard
A: Just smile! We can all get through the day.
B: Er, I'm not comfortable trying to change my current smiling rate.
A: Sweetie, you just have to listen to me.
B: Please don't call me that. The clients do it too.
A: I hate to say it, but I told you so- they think of you as young.
B: I know.
A: How confident are you in the team room? You should speak up more. Have you weighed the pros and cons of being do quiet?
B: I'm pretty confident. I didn't speak up much today, but-
A: Well, there's always next time. The best thing you can do is just stay positive.
