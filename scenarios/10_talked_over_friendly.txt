Context:
Giving someone feedback on being talked over
What do you think of the feedback recipient's response? Is it desirable? Is it realistic?

A: Thanks for taking the time for this feedback session.
B: No problem
A: There's something that's been bothering me that I think that you might not be aware of.
B: Oh?
A: Okay, so I know that this is hard, but frequently in team meetings, when I present an idea, I feel disregarded because you start talking while I'm still talking.
B: What makes you say that?
A: When you talk over me in meetings, it makes me less willing to express my ideas. It makes me feel like my ideas aren't worth listening to, and you're not interested in hearing them.
B: Huh.
A: It comes across as if you don't respect or value my ideas.
B: Oh wow, I hadn't noticed that. I need to learn how to notice when I do that.
