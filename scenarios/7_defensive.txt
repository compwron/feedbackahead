Defensive reaction to feedback

A: So, while we're doing feedback, I was worried by what I heard yesterday at the team meeting
B: You mean when I told Rachel that the code was bad? You know I didn't mean that
A: No, I meant when we talked about code coverage
B: Well, I mean, what else was I supposed to do?
A: Well-
B: No but seriously, I'd like to see anyone do better. It was a hard situation. You can't blame me for that.
A: I'm not blaming you-
B: Well, I blame myself, and I'll try to do better, but I'm not sure how and I don't think that anyone knows how, either.
