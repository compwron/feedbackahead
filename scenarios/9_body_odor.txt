Body odor

A: Do you have a minute? Can we take a walk, maybe go get coffee?
B: Sure
A: Ok, so, this is a delicate topic but I feel like you would want to know
B: Okaaaaaaay?
A: You have body odor
B: Oh no. How bad?
A: Um, well, I think I'm not the only person to have noticed. It's pretty distinct when you come into the team room.
B: Wow, this is super embarrassing. I mean- I don't think that I have a smell
A: I don't know whether it's an aftershave, or shoes, or clothes, or whatever. And of course feel free to ask me any time whether I'm- perceiving anything- and I'll let you know.
B: Ok, thanks. I'll try.
