Body odor

A: Hey, do you have a minute? How about that room over there?
B: OK, sure
A: Ok, so, this is going to be awkward but I feel like you would want to know... when we pair I can smell your breath. A lot.
B: Oh no. How bad?
A: Um, well, it's pretty intense. I think I'm not the only person to have noticed.
B: Wow, I didn't know. I will try to fix that.
A: If there's anything I can do, let me know. If you just want to know whether it's still going on, ask me and I can say.
B: Ok, thanks.
