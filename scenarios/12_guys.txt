A: Thanks for taking time to do feedback. What's up?
B: Anytime. Um well, one thing- it bothers me when you refer to the team as "guys"
A: ...? Huh?
B: I am not a guy.
A: Well, but it's a general plural
B: There are so many alternatives. Y'all, team, fellow humans...
A: This seems really silly
B: It really bothers me to be referred to by "guys" it feels like I'm not included
A: You're totally included!
B: In order to make me feel included, I would prefer to be referred to by a word that does not exclude my gender.
