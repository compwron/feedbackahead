Giving feedback on unprofessional attire
Think about: how/when should this be done? How did these people do?

A: Is now an ok time for feedback?
B: Sure
A: Okay so this is a little bit of a sensitive topic, but I'm concerned that sometimes your attire is not professional.
B: When?
A: Well, specifically when you wear the ripped tshirts and jeans, it seems like a style choice that isn't very professional.
B: Has anyone complained?
A: No, but we don't want it to get that far. Can you wear clothes that aren't ripped to the client site?
B: This is a style. Being fashionable isn't unprofessional.
