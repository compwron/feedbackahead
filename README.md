## Scenarios for a feedback workshop

These scenarios are specifically aimed at software consultants in an agile environment, but they might be generalizable beyond that context.

### Workshop:

- Two participants each read one role of an excercise out loud
- The facilitator takes commentary from the audience and participants about how they think that each character felt about the portrayed interaction
- One of the participants swaps with an audience member
- Perform a new exercise and repeat the audience participation step.

These workshop materials are intended to create good discussions, not to recommend how to deal with difficult situations; but some recommendations have snuck in.
